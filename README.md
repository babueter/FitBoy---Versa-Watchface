# FitBoy---Versa-Watchface
"Pip Boy" type watchface for the Fitbit Versa

It's a watchface for the Fitbit Versa that looks like a PipBoy.
Everything other than the icons or the Vault Boy is drawn in place.

At some point, I will likely replace the Vault Boy with a generic smiley face (or something like it), just to make sure there are no copyright issues. That aside, I think I'm done with this one.
